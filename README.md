Welcome to my GitHub! I'm **Christina Ennis**, a computational biologist with 7+ years of experience developing machine learning–driven pipelines for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to uncover mechanisms of immune response and tumor heterogeneity. 

I hold a [PhD in Molecular and Translational Medicine](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/gms/mtm/) from [Boston University Chobanian & Avedesian School of Medicine](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/), where I studied how metabolism shapes T cell behavior in breast cancer using scRNA-seq and organoid models. Previously at [Dana-Farber](https://wulab.dfci.harvard.edu/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://pklab.med.harvard.edu/), I developed scalable pipelines to analyze immune diversity and tumor–immune interactions. My work bridges single-cell technologies, machine learning, and immuno-oncology to advance translational discovery.
