# About Me 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m **Christina Ennis**, an immunologist turned computational scientist with 7+ years of experience uncovering the biological stories hidden within complex datasets. Here’s a bit about me:

## 🌟 Highlights
- 🎓 I am earning my [PhD in Molecular and Translational Medicine](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/gms/mtm/) from [Boston University Chobanian & Avedesian School of Medicine](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/), where I study how patient metabolism orchestrates T cell function in breast cancer using single-cell RNA sequencing and 3D organoid systems. I completed my [B.A. in Neuroscience](https://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-and-majors/neuroscience/) from [Kenyon College](https://www.kenyon.edu/), with research on the enteric nervous system.
- 🧬 Prior to my PhD, I worked as a [Research Technician and Collaborator](https://wulab.dfci.harvard.edu/) at the [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) and [Harvard Medical School Department of Bioinformatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/), where I developed computational pipelines for analyzing immune cell diversity and conducted research on immune-tumor interactions in hematological malignancies. 
- 🛠 **Key Skills**: single-cell RNA sequencing, computational pipeline development, bioinformatics analysis, data visualization, multiparameter flow cytometry, 3D organoid modeling
- 🔍 **Interests**: cancer immunology, tumor microenvironment, metabolic reprogramming, single-cell technologies, translational medicine

## 🔧 Featured Projects
- 🔬 [**Organoid Modeling Toolkit**](https://github.com/montilab/BrCaExoPDO): Tools and scripts for generating and analyzing 3D patient-derived organoid models, enabling studies on breast cancer exosomes and their impact on tumor-immune interactions in the microenvironment.
- 🧪 [**scRNAseq Analysis Pipeline**](https://github.com/robertfisher002/CoREST_Splicing/tree/main/Mouse%20%26%20Immunotherapy): A scalable pipeline for processing and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, featuring integration, dimensionality reduction, and immune profiling workflows.
